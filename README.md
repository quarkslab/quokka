## Introduction

Quokka is a binary exporter: from the disassembly of a program, it generates
an export file that can be used without the disassembler.

The main objective of **Quokka** is to enable to completely manipulate the
binary without ever opening a disassembler after the initial step. Moreover, it
abstracts the disassembler's API to expose a clean interface to the users.

Quokka is heavily inspired by [BinExport](https://github.com/google/binexport),
the binary exporter used by BinDiff.

## Installation

### Python plugin

The plugin is built in the CI and available in the
[registry](https://github.com/quarkslab/quokka/packages).

It should be possible to install directly from PIP using this kind of commmand:

```commandline
$ pip install quokka-project
```

### IDA Plugin

Note: The IDA plugin is not needed to read a `Quokka` generated file. It is
only used to generate them.

Quokka is currently compatible with IDA 7.3+

The plugin is built on the CI and available in the
[Release](https://github.com/quarkslab/quokka/releases/new) tab.

To download the plugin, get the file named `quokka_plugin**.so`.

## Usage

### Export a file

!!! note

    This requires a working IDA installation.


- Either using command line:
```commandline
$ idat64 -OQuokkaAuto:true -A /path/to/hello.i64
```

Note: We are using `idat64` and not `ida64` to increase the export speed
because we don't need the graphical interface.

- Using the plugin shortcut inside IDA: (by default) Alt+A

### Export a file in batch

One can write its own bash script run multiple `idat64` in parallel. However,
Quokka provides an utility tool to automatically export all executable files
of a given directory in parallel. An example to automate the export using 8 threads:

```commandline
$ quokka-cli -t 8 dir/
```


### Load an export file

```python
import quokka

# Directly from the binary (requires the IDA plugin to be installed)
ls = quokka.Program.from_binary("/bin/ls")

# From the exported file
ls = quokka.Program("ls.quokka",  # the exported file 
                    "/bin/ls")    # the original binary
```

## Building

The process for building depends on which version of the IDA SDK you are using.
These two modes are also referred as *the new mode* and *the old mode*.

### IDA < 9.2 (The old way)

Since the IDA SDK is still proprietary code, you have to fetch it yourself and provide
its path to cmake through the option `-DIdaSdk_ROOT_DIR:STRING=path/to/sdk`

**NOTE:** This will also work on newer versions but it requires more steps from
the users as they will have to download the sdk themselves.

```console
user@host:~/quokka$ cmake -B build \ # Where to build
                          -S . \ # Where are the sources
                          -DIdaSdk_ROOT_DIR:STRING=path/to/ida_sdk \ # Path to IDA SDK 
                          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \ # Build Type

user@host:~/quokka$ cmake --build build --target quokka_plugin -- -j
```

### IDA >= 9.2 (The new way)

Ida SDK has been finally [open sourced](https://github.com/HexRaysSA/ida-sdk) so there is no need
anymore to download it separately.

You can use the cmake option `-DIDA_VERSION=<major>.<minor>` to automatically sync it from github.

```console
user@host:~/quokka$ cmake -B build \ # Where to build
                          -S . \ # Where are the sources
                          -DIDA_VERSION=9.2 \ # IDA SDK version
                          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \ # Build Type

user@host:~/quokka$ cmake --build build --target quokka_plugin -- -j
```

### Install

To install the plugin:

```console
user@host:~/quokka$ cmake --install build
```

In any case, the plugin will also be in `build/quokka-install`. You can
copy it to IDA's user plugin directory.

```console
user@host:~/quokka$ cp build/quokka-install/quokka*64.so $HOME/.idapro/plugins/
```

## Exporting modes

Quokka offers two modes to export the disassembly analysis: the **light mode** and the **self contained mode**.

The **light mode** focuses on exporting only essential information, producing fast and lightweight files. In this mode no information at instruction level or below is exported, so the capstone engine will be used at runtime to obtain the instructions' disassembly.

The **self contained mode** instead exports the full disassembly, exactly how the backend disassembler shows it. This will produce heavier files but it doesn't require depending on third party disassemblers at runtime.

It's important to note that both modes offer the same API in the python bindings.

> [!WARNING]
> From the *self contained mode* it is still possible to obtain the capstone instruction object
> but beware that the capstone disassembly might be different than the one exported by quokka
> (instructions might be splitted, merged, not supported, have different mnemonics, etc.).
> In general different binary analysis platforms produce different disassembly, keep this in mind
> when mixing capstone with the self contained mode.

For a complete overview of the difference between the two modes look at the table below:

|  | Light Mode | Self contained Mode |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Functions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Basic Blocks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Instructions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Operands | ❌ | ✅ |
| Data References | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cross References | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sections/Layout | ✅ | ✅ |
| Decompilation | ✅¹ | ✅¹ |
| CFG drawing coordinates | ✅¹² | ✅¹² |

<sup>¹ Optionally enabled</sup>

<sup>² Currently not supported</sup>
